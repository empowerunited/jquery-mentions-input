jquery.mentionsInput
=================
jquery.mentionsInput is a small, but awesome UI component that allows you to "@mention" someone in a text message, just like you are used to on Facebook or Twitter.

This project is written by [Kenneth Auchenberg](http://kenneth.io), and started as an internal project at [Podio](http://podio.com), but has then been open sourced to give it a life in the community.

This is a fork of the jquery.mentionsInput that is and will be modified a lot by Nickolay Tzvetinov (https://github.com/meddle0x53) part of the Empower United team.

## Current additions to the base functionality:
- Many tags with the same name can be added (for example if you have two different users named 'Kurt Cobain').
- Easy and facebook like deleting of tags.
- Tags can be added manualy in the format @[some-tag](user:id). User is only an option.
- Many bugfixes (although there are a lot of bug to fix too)
